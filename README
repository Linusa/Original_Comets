This project was done for an Object-Oriented class. The main class, CometsMain, was given
to us, and we created all of the other classes to match the specifications. The game has
a ship, which is a circle with a line displaying the heading, and comets, which are also
circles. The ship shoots circles that represent Shots and can destroy Comets. Large
Comets spawn MediumComets which in turn spawn SmallComets. The game starts with two Large
Comets, and then when all the comets spawned are gone the game waits to be closed.
